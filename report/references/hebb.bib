  abstract = {{Donald Hebb pioneered many current themes in
                 behavioural neuroscience. He saw psychology as a
                 biological science, but one in which the organization
                 of behaviour must remain the central concern. Through
                 penetrating theoretical concepts, including the "cell
                 assembly," "phase sequence," and "Hebb synapse," he
                 offered a way to bridge the gap between cells, circuits
                 and behaviour. He saw the brain as a dynamically
                 organized system of multiple distributed parts, with
                 roots that extend into foundations of development and
                 evolutionary heritage. He understood that behaviour, as
                 brain, can be sliced at various levels and that one of
                 our challenges is to bring these levels into both
                 conceptual and empirical register. He could move
                 between theory and fact with an ease that continues to
                 inspire both students and professional investigators.
                 Although facts continue to accumulate at an
                 accelerating rate in both psychology and neuroscience,
                 and although these facts continue to force revision in
                 the details of Hebb's earlier contributions, his
                 overall insistence that we look at behaviour and brain
                 together â within a dynamic, relational and
                 multilayered framework â remains. His work touches
                 upon current studies of population coding, contextual
                 factors in brain representations, synaptic plasticity,
                 developmental construction of brain/behaviour
                 relations, clinical syndromes, deterioration of
                 performance with age and disease, and the formal
                 construction of connectionist models. The collection of
                 papers in this volume represent these and related
                 themes that Hebb inspired. We also acknowledge our
                 appreciation for Don Hebb as teacher, colleague and
                 friend.}},
